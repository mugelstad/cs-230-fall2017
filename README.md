Represenation of CS230 Data Structures final project at Wellesley College

# Project outline
I collaborated with a team of two others to program a geocaching/scavenger hunt game using various data structures. It is complete with a user's manual and a technical report.

# Technical details
This project used two Applied Data Types (ADTs). In particular, it made use of a complete graph called Map that extended Graph from the javafoundations package. This was used to organize the locations on the map. It also used LinkedLists. Specifically, LinkedLists were used for two primary functions: keeping track of each node on the map and keeping track of the clues associated with each node.
